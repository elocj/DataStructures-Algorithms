Lab 4: Library

1) Describe the state of your program

I believe everything that was requested in the Lab 4 Assignment Guide has been completed including the use of factories.

2) The hash tables I used were in bookfactory.cpp and commandfactory.cpp and each hash table was used to store either book objects or command objects that could be called and returned. The names of these are called ‘call’ for the commands and ‘genres’ for the book.

3) I read the book data in manager.cpp which gets a book object from the factory and uses its built-in setData function to set the data of the book.

4) I read in the command data in the manager.cpp which get a command object from the factory and uses its built in setData function to set the data of the book.

5) I don’t believe I have a dirty little secret. I only used the if/switch in the case that the command file reads in ‘D’ which triggers my program to print the library of books in order. I believe this obeys open-close principal because this is not a child of ‘Command’ and its code will remain the same regardless of if more commands are entered into the command factory.

6) Something I am very proud of is the time management I put into this assignment. In my team’s design I think we could have done a better job of time management which is why I really wanted to focus on that part of this project.
